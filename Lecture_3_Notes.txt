(Slide 5): 

Gate Level Simulation- Not usually done, but if have poor coding style, software bugs, may mis interpret the wanted design.

(Slide  8): 

	Entity-
		Architecture
			Process

Component is an entity inside another entity

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Slide 11):

Order of signal assignments inside processes does not matter as RHS is computed first, and then assigned to LHS.

It is the clock that instantiates a the flip flop.

IF had inside a process had D<=2, D<=3, this is ok, but D>=3 wins. In concurrent statement raises an error as makes a short circuit essentially.

(Slide 14):

With variables, the order matters!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Slide 20):


If leave out Sel, it will not be updated ad circuit (in simulation will be wrong). In hardware may still work.

If don't assign output to all possible cases, will result a latch. This will give warning.

99% of cases latches are unwanted.

Can have defaults i.e. F<=W before BEGIN

Clock Domain Crossing:

Need to sync pointers, do this using grey coding.
